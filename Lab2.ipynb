On my pc, even on larger instances, it is able to provide a solution even in less than 1 second (I know that time is not a unit measure, but, since the fitness is not so clear and well defined in this context, at least there's a reference of execution time on a machine).  \n",

    "The second algorithm provided for this lab is a mix of many strategies. The skeleton is given by the genetuic algorithm (steady state model) that uses, as a flow, the modern strategy (pick two parents, perform crossover and mutate the child before adding it to the offspring). Regarding mutation and crossover, I decided to use 2-opt, as I did for simulated annealing, for mutation, while I used the inver Over crossover. In reality, the inver Over crossover have been slightly modified in order to execute, with a certain (low) probability simulated annealing on the child produced by the two parents. This strategy allowed to reach much better results. As I did for the first algorithm, also in this case parameters have been fine-tuned in order to obtain better results and other considerations are left to trials_tsp.ipynb where you can see the entire flow of reasoning, if interested.\n",
    "As starting point for the EA many trials have been done, at the end I decided to use both efficient solutions and randomic solutions. More efficient solutions are added to the initial population using the first algorithm (the fast one). You can have a look at their percentage in the code below, or even to results obtained by changing them in the aforementioned file."
